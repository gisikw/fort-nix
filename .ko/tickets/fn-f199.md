# Investigate automatic GPU fault detection and PCI reset (monit-style watchdog)

## Notes

**2026-02-22 23:10:27 UTC:** Consider a systemd service that watches dmesg for GCVM_L2_PROTECTION_FAULT and auto-triggers PCI remove/rescan. Must stop ollama first, do the reset, then restart. Alternative: ollama healthcheck wrapper that tries a tiny inference and triggers recovery on fault. Ref: fn-db64 for the basic recovery script.
