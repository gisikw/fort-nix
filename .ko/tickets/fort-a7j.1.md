# Break down work calendar sync epic into tickets

**Instructions for local agent:**

1. Read the parent epic (fort-a7j) for desired state
2. Explore the fort-nix codebase to understand:
   - How services are currently deployed
   - Where vdirsyncer/khal would fit in the NixOS module structure
   - What secrets/credentials management looks like
3. Clarify any ambiguities with Kevin (OAuth setup, which host, etc.)
4. Create tickets under this epic for the actual implementation work

This ticket was created by Exo (exocortex) as a cross-repo handoff. The goal is to test product-manager-style delegation where requirements come from one context and implementation planning happens in another.
