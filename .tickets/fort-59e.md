# Formalize incident response and blameless post-mortem process

Create a structured process for handling incidents, possibly as a skill or documented workflow.

Should include:
- Incident declaration and triage
- Debugging workflow (what to check first, how to escalate)
- Blameless post-mortem template
- After-action ticketing (like we did for the 2026-01-01 headscale outage)
- Timeline reconstruction

Could be a skill that guides through the process, or a documented runbook in AGENTS.md.

Context: The 2026-01-01 headscale outage was handled ad-hoc but produced good outcomes (root cause found, 7 follow-up tickets). Formalizing this would make future incidents smoother.
