# Improve Home Assistant dashboard usability

Current HA dashboard is a mess - everything exposed alphabetically with device IDs everywhere.

Inspiration:
- Map-based floorplan dashboards (reddit examples)
- Pokemon spritesheet style
- Stardew Valley aesthetic
- Basically anything visual/spatial rather than list-based

Research needed:
- What HA dashboard tools/cards support this (custom:floorplan, picture-elements, etc.)
- How to create/source appropriate sprites/floorplan images
- Wife approval on aesthetic direction

Goal: Dashboard that's actually pleasant to use and shows spatial context.
