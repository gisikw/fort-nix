# lordhenry GPU broken: BIOS allocates 32GB VRAM despite 64GB setting, all GPU compute page-faults. GMKtec EVO-X2 BIOS 1.05 likely needs 'with LLM' firmware (251028b). rocminfo sees device fine but any inference crashes with GCVM_L2_PROTECTION_FAULT. May need BIOS extraction from GMKtec's Windows ISO.
