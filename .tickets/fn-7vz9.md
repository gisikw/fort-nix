# Darwin host provisioning runbook

Document the manual provisioning steps for a darwin host: create admin user, enable SSH, add authorized keys, power management settings (restart on power loss, restart on freeze, disable sleep), disable auto-updates, install Nix, install nix-darwin, clone fort-nix, initial darwin-rebuild switch. This is the 10-minute keyboard-and-monitor procedure.
