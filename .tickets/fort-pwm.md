# Add CalDAV/CardDAV stack (radicale, khal, vdirsyncer)

Add calendar and contacts sync infrastructure:
- radicale: CalDAV/CardDAV server
- khal: Calendar CLI client
- vdirsyncer: Sync tool for calendars/contacts

Research which components are needed and how they integrate. Consider SSO integration for radicale.
